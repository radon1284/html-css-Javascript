### What is HTML?
**HTML** = *Hypertext Markup Language*

HTML is a computer language devised to allow website creation. These websites can then be viewed by anyone else connected to the Internet. It is relatively easy to learn, with the basics being accessible to most people in one sitting; and quite powerful in what it allows you to create.

### How does it work?

HTML consists of a series of short codes typed into a text-file by the site author â€” these are the tags. The text is then saved as a html file, and viewed through a browser. eg.(`index.html`).
