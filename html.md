### What is HTML?
**HTML** = *Hypertext Markup Language*

HTML is a computer language devised to allow website creation. These websites can then be viewed by anyone else connected to the Internet. It is relatively easy to learn, with the basics being accessible to most people in one sitting; and quite powerful in what it allows you to create.

### How does it work?

HTML consists of a series of short codes typed into a text-file by the site author — these are the tags. The text is then saved as a html file, and viewed through a browser. eg.(`index.html`).

### What are the tags up to?

The tags are what separate normal text from HTML code. You might know them as the words between the `<angle-brackets>`. They allow all the cool stuff like images and tables and stuff, just by telling your browser what to render on the page. Different tags will perform different functions. The tags themselves don’t appear when you view your page through a browser, but their effects do. The simplest tags do nothing more than apply formatting to some text, like this:

Example:
```html
<strong>**These words will be bold**</strong>, and these will not.
```
